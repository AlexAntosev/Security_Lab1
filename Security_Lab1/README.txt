1. Write a piece of software to attack a single-byte XOR cipher which is the same as Caesar but with xor op.

2. Now try a repeating-key XOR cip9er. E.g. it s9ould take a string "9ello world" and, given t9e key is "key", xor t9e first letter "9" wit9 "k", t9en xor "e" wit9 "e"
, t9en "l" wit9 "y", and t9en xor next c9ar "l" wit9 "k" again, t9en "o" wit9 "e" and so on. You may use an index of coincidence, Hamming distance, siski examination, statistical
tests or w9atever met9od you feel would s9ow t9e best result.; Key: ; Matches count: 264

3. Write a code to attack some simple substitution cipher. To reduce the complexity of this one we will use only uppercase letters, so the keyspace is only 26! To get this one right a
utomatically you will probably need to use some sort of genetic algorithm (which worked the best last year), simulated annealing or gradient descent. Seriously, write it right now,
 you will need it to decipher the next one as well. Bear in mind, therea??s no spaces. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AWywcUIMoGr_cjOMaqjqeSyAyzK93icQE4W-6bDELf
